# MZBFromT2

This is the repository associated with the publication "Human marginal zone B cell development from early T2 progenitors" by Tull et al.

This Github repo contains the code necessary to reproduce the analyses presented in the above publication.

/scripts/MhiMlo contains code needed to recreate the Seurat objects demonstrating IgM^hi and IgM^lo Transitional B cells as seen in Figure 3 "Transcriptomic analysis of IgMhi and IgMlo TS B cells demonstrates differentupstream regulators of phenotype."

/scripts/MZBTrajectory contains code needed to recreate the Seurat objects from Figure 4 "Lineage progression from IgMhi TS B cells through to MZB.". Individual contains code to process and name clusters subsets from individual healthy donors (Fig 4A,B,C,D), and Integrated contains code to integrate all 3 donors and run trajectory analysis (Fig 4E,F,G,H,I)
